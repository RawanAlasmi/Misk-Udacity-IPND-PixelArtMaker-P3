## The Project Details
In this project, we are given a starter template. Using this template, I'm building the script to do the following:

1. Upon form submission, build the grid.
   * The form provides the number of rows (via the grid height) and columns (via the grid width).
   * The grid is a ```<table>```.
2. Upon clicking on a single grid square, color that square's background color to the currently selected hex color.
3. Build it with JavaScript (not jQuery).
